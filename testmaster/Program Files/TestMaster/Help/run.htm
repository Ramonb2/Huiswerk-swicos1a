      <p><font
        color="#000000">Each question in the set is displayed in turn, the order 
        being randomized if this option has been selected by the question set 
        author, with the question text appearing first followed by the list of 
        possible answers. If an exhibit (graphic) has been included for the question 
        this will also be displayed.</font></p>

              Previous question in the set.</font></li>
            <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Goto</strong> - opens a window with 
              a list of question numbers to permit the user to select/view question 
              required. This is particularly useful to go to Marked questions 
              (see below). Close this window by double clicking on a question 
              number. </font></li>

        <li><font color="#000000"><strong>End Test</strong> - stops the timer, 
          evaluates results and enables the review button if errors were made.<br>
          Note: TestMaster keeps a tally of all the questions viewed (whatever 
          order they are viewed in) and evaluates the result based on the number 
          of questions seen and how many of those were answered correctly. This 
          allows the user to get a fair representation of their success even if 
          only part of the test is completed.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Mark</strong> - sets the current question 
          as marked (or clears the mark) so that it may be reviewed later. To 
          review marked questions use the Goto button which shows all marked questions.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Answer</strong> - if enabled, this shows 
          the answer to the current question and any comments / explanation provided.<br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Save Results</strong> - on completion 
          of a test the evaluated results can be saved to the summary file. If 
          an attempt to close the window is made without saving the results the 
          user is prompted to save them.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Review</strong> - the 'End Test' button 
          when pressed becomes the Review button if any answers were incorrect. 
          All incorrect answers can then be reviewed using the Next/Previous buttons. 
          The correct answer and comments (if provided) will be displayed along 
          with the user's incorrect answer.</font></li>
